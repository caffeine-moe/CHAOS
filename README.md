## Install and Usage
- Make sure you have Java 17+ installed
- Download the jar file from the [latest release](https://github.com/caffeine-moe/CHAOS/releases/latest)
- The config for CHAOS will be in the same directory from where you run it so I would recommend putting `CHAOS-all.jar` into its own directory somewhere easily accessible.
- Run CHAOS by opening a command prompt/terminal window in the folder and running `java -jar "CHAOS-all.jar"`
- Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ASukH9Juxz) if you run into any problems :)
